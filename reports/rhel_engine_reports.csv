RHSA-2024:0452,Red Hat Security Advisory: curl security update,Moderate,MODERATE,False,True,1000.service;NetworkManager.service,"The advisory RHSA-2024:0452 affects the curl packages, requiring restarts of NetworkManager.service and 1000.service due to moderate impact. No reboot is required as only userspace services are impacted with two affected services. The service restarts do not require a reboot but will affect network connectivity until completed.","- **Execution Domain**: This advisory impacts USERSPACE, affecting the curl packages which are primarily user-space applications. The direct_exec count is 0, indicating no kernel-level changes or dependencies.
- **Service Restart Requirements**: Two services (NetworkManager.service and 1000.service) require restarts to mitigate the impact of this advisory. NetworkManager.service manages network connections and 1000.service likely controls some system-wide settings that may be affected by the curl package updates.
- **Dependency Fanout**: The dependency fanout level is VERY_HIGH, indicating a significant number of services (average reverse deps: 131.2) are potentially impacted. However, since only userspace services are involved and no kernel-level changes are required, this advisory does not necessitate a reboot.
- **Core System Involvement**: The curl packages do not involve core system components or boot-time dependencies, ensuring that the impact is contained within the user-space environment."
